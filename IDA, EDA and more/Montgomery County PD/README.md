# 🚔 Montgomery County Police Department: A thorough Crime analysis 🚔
An analysis of real-world data on all founded crimes reported in the County from 2016 to 2022.

### 🚩PROBLEM CONTEXT 🚩
The MCPD has the resources and the inter-agency relationships to patrol communities, investigate incidents, and disrupt criminal activity; However, due to an ever-changing crime landscape, there are still question marks over which categories of crime will increase or decrease from month to month or year to year. It is also challenging to determine with precision where the hotspots are within each police district, which limits the ability to design targeted interventions. The dataset is also limited regarding which crimes have the most impact on victims; a concerning oversight.
These limitations relate to a problem in the quality of the dataset itself: missing values, inconsistent column headers, improper data types, and geographic coordinates that are not accurate collectively undermine confidence in any conclusions drawn from the data.

### PROJECT OBJECTIVES 🎯
1. To spatially map out the geographical boundaries of all police districts in Montgomery County.
2. To identify the top three crime categories that most severely affect victims by analysing crime frequency and severity indicators within the dataset.
3. Determine the city that records the highest number of incidents under offence code 2305 by performing city level counts and comparisons.
4. To analyze the monthly and yearly crime trends from 2018 to 2022 for any major increases, decreases, or seasonal patterns within that time period.
